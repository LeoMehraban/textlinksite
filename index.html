    <p>
    TextLink is a web protocol for two types of people:
    
    - people who want to share there ideas with the world, but don't know HTML
    - people who are frusterated over ads slowing down webpages
    </p>
    <h1> The Interface </h1>
    <p>
    TextLink runs in the terminal. once you have installed it, you can run <code>~> textlink </code> to run it
    this is the output:
    <code>
    Welcome to The TextLink 0.1 Client!<br>

    Enter Command (or type help):
    </code>
    to run the sample code, type <code>code</code>
    you will see this
    <code>
    Enter Command (or type help): code<br>

    [3] Cool Stuff <br>
    </code>
    now to go to a link, you look at the webpage, you find the link number for the one you want to go to, for example if you want to go to <code>Cool Stuff</code>
    the number would be 3, next type <code> link (link number) </code> so if i wanted to go to cool stuff, i would type <code>link 3</code>
    <br>now, going to a url
    that would be <code> go url </code> so if i wanted to go to this site in textlink, i would say <code> go leomehraban.github.io/textlinksite/index.txtl </code>
